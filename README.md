## What are LuciTools?
LuciTools are outcome of my learning. So I am learning about building my own Hacking Tools, that I can use during Pentesting, CTFs, or any such Competition.
As a result I am building some basic tools using different languages and uploading them here.

## Discalimer!
These are part of my learning, so if you wish to use the code anyhow, I will not be responsible for any outcome.
